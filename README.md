# nix-config

_This is my nix config. There are many like it, but this one is mine._

This config is based on https://github.com/dustinlyons/nixos-config. It
replaces my previous config https://github.com/hardselius/dotfiles which was
much more of a patchwork of stuff I'd found and figured out on my own. The main
reason for switching is I didn't feel like spending time porting my old config
to something that worked with
https://github.com/DeterminateSystems/nix-installer.
